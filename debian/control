Description: gazebo_video_monitor_plugins is a package that lets the user record videos of a Gazebo simulation.
 It provides a multicamera sensor that can be used for creating different types of videos with multiple views from inside the gazebo world. There is a number of plugins already available in the package, but more can be developed by the user, with minimal effort, to fit arbitrary use cases.
